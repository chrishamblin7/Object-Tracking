# Object-Tracking
George A. Alvarez and Patrick Cavanagh at Harvard vision Lab have previously shown hemifield independence for object tracking tasks. See http://scorsese.wjh.harvard.edu/George/pdfs/Alvarez_Cavanagh_PsychSci_2005.pdf  This display is coded in matlab using the psychtoolbox to see if hemifield independence holds under different tracking tasks.
